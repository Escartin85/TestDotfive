## How long did you spend on the coding test?
For answer the questions of the test I spent 1h 42 min.
To do the coding test I spent 4h 26 min.

## Did you manage to cover everything that you wanted to?
NO. I would like it to finish it properly.
Initially I have to say I could work all time directly. But I just got problems, unspected bill that I should cover urgently. So I needed to force my self to work in the small breaks that I have 2 or 3 hours dayly.
Initially, I did almost in 3 hours. Then I Stopped, no bacuse I wanted, if not because I need it work on my delivery job, for get urgent money. Then In next day that I have free time. I spent other 1h and 26 min, to leave finished the code for the CRUD, and a simple Test.

The dilema is that In the code test, I asking for take 1 option of 3: And as I like to work, I needed to take or do 2 options. You will see that in the code. I took to do:
- Responsive design
- And manage accounts of new users (login and register)

Basically I would decide to not do the login and register, but as is what I wanted to do it from the beginning. I continue with my decision. When I mean that I needed to take 2 of 3 points for the maner I work. Is because I don't like to much write backend, and to have and horrible view in html. I could do it with simple basic html. But I can't leave it like that, when I am working alone.

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I would like to have more time, for work more writting proper tests.
And Imprube the code of the responsive design.

## Would you choose different technologies if this were to become a reliable enterprise system? Why? Or, why not?
Yes, and Not.
No, when is talking about the technology dedicated to the backend (Python / Django). Because they can allow to scale the system easyly.
Yes, when Is about to develop the frontend, working with the html/css/javascript code. I considere that If this would be a project that have to scale. May be is better use React. Just for one reason: 
- Component or code can be reuseble with more facility for other projects. Even that for same project in other part of code.
But maybe this would force to change a bit in the backend, developing and Rest Api.
